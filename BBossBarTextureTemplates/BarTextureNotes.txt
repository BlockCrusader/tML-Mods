=======================================
 NOTES FOR MAKING CUSTOM BAR TEXTURES:
=======================================

NEVER alter the file's dimensions! Otherwise your bar's drawing will get offset and messed up.

The texture is split vertically into 3 segments, each 90 pixels tall; the Frame, Fill, and Back.
Make sure each part of the bar stays in its respective section, lest it bleed into other parts of bar.
The Back is drawn first, then the Fill, and finally the Frame.

The fill 'drains' in-game by drawing less and less of the left end of the fill texture.
Thus, there can't really be a 'cap' on the left end of the fill; it'll be chopped off once the bar starts draining.

Keep in mind that players can customize the transparency of the Fill and Back.

Optional details:
- You don't need a Back piece if you don't want one on your bar

- Decorations at the 75%/50%/25% marks of the bar aren't mandatory, but serve as a helpful visual for quickly gauging boss HP at a glance
