#Contributing Localization
As noted in the main README file, localization contributions are welcomed and appreciated. If you desire to contribute localization to one of my mods, please note the below directions;
- When your localization is ready, make a PR in this repository. Once I see the PR I'll make sure everything looks good and then merge it and download the .hjson file for use in the mod.
- Your .hjson file should go in the same folder/namespace you found this file.
- The .hjson file should follow the same naming convention as the english version. For example; Block's Info Accessories uses 'en-US_Mods.BInfoAcc.hjson' for English, and 'zh-Hans_Mods.BInfoAcc.hjson' for Simplified Chinese.
- Some mods use the convention 'en-US_Mods' for their localization files and don't include the mod name. In this case, you should add a prefix with the mod's internal name so the respective mod can be easily identified. For example, Simplified Chinese localization for Arsenal would be 'Arsenal_Mod_zh-Hans.hjson' instead of just 'zh-Hans.hjson'.
