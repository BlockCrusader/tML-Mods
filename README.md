# BlockCrusader/tML-Mods
This GitHub repository hosts tmod files for all of my released mods for tModLoader (Terraria). This is intended to function as an alternative method for downloading my mods, if you play tML on Steam it is better to access my mods by subscribing to them on tML's Steam Workshop.

## Downloading & Installing a Mod:
To download and install a mod from this repository, you do NOT need to fork or download the repository. Likewise, a GitHub account is NOT necessary. Simply follow the steps below;
Step 1: Find the desired mod's tmod file in the repository (Code tab), and click on it to view it
Step 2: When viewing the file, find a button near the right side of your screen that says 'Download raw file' when hovered over (It should be near another button with a pencil icon) and click it to download the tmod file
Step 3: Once you have the tmod file, open your file explorer and find tML's Mods folder; move the tmod file there (Example filepath on Windows: C:\Users\[user name here]\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Mods)
Step 4: Launch tModLoader and check your mods list to confirm the mod has been added to your lists. Activate and profit!

## Concerning Open Source:
Note that this repository does NOT have an open source license. It should only be used as an alternative method for downloading the hosted mods. 
Most, but not all of my mods are open source; you should be able to use tModLoader's in-game extract function to view the source for such mods. If a mod's source cannot be extracted by tML, then it is not open source. If the mod can be extracted, then it should have an accompanying open-source license.

## Concerning Contributions:
As a hobbyist modder, I am not accepting direct content contributions to my mods; I simply prefer to work on my own passion projects on my own. 
However, things such as bug fixes, localization, polishing code, and even wikis are all welcomed and appreciated. I've discontinued supporting individual GitHub repositories for my mods, so if you want to make some sort of contribution the best way to do so is to make a PR or Issue post to this repository. I won't directly merge anything since only the tmod files are kept here, but this will give me convenient access to review contributions and download them for assimilation into the target mod(s).

## Concerning Bug Reports:
As stated above, I've discontinued supporting individual GitHub repositories for my mods. Thus, if you'd like to use GitHub to report a bug in one of my mods, the best place to do it is at this repository, as an Issue post (Or PR if you've made a fix).
